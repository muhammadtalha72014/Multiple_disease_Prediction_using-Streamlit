# Multiple Disease Prediction App using Streamlit
## Introduction
This repository contains machine learning models developed to predict the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The models were trained on respective datasets and then integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit application, allowing users to input relevant data and receive disease predictions instantly.

## Disease Prediction Models
- Diabetes Prediction Model: This model is designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes. It uses features such as glucose level, blood pressure, and other medical data to make predictions.

- Heart Disease Prediction Model: The heart disease prediction model assesses the risk of heart disease. It utilizes features like cholesterol levels, age, sex, and other clinical parameters to estimate the likelihood of heart disease.

- Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model: This model is built to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease. It analyzes vocal and other medical data to determine the probability of the disease.

Each model is trained, validated, and saved for use in the Streamlit application.

## Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application serves as an interactive platform where users can input their medical data and receive predictions from the pre-trained models. The app is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to get accurate predictions with minimal effort.

Below are screenshots showcasing the interface of the Streamlit application and sample prediction results:
